# Spotify-Top-200-Songs-Analysis
This Repo contains the source file and the Jupyter Notebook  File that contains the contents of data cleaning and analyzation.

1. Most of the work in the file contains Data cleaning as all the contents were Object data types so we had to first:

   A. Remove Null Values.

   B. Remove empty spaces.

   C. Using lambda to remove signs and symbols and split columns.

   D. Converting Date time column to proper date time format and splitting them to day and month name.

   E. Converting Numeric datas from object to int and float.

2. Analyzed and visualized data on -

   A. Top streamed song.

   B. Top artist followers related to that song.

   C. Top genre related song.

   D. Correlation between Stream and artist followers.


If you think there could have been more things that can be done, feel free to try it out ourselves and share it with me so that i can learn from it as well.
